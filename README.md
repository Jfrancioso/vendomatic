Welcome to PlushPalooza VendoMatic, where cuteness is our currency and you will leave with a new best friend! This is a command-line interface program that simulates a vending machine selling stuffed animals. The program allows users to view the inventory of stuffed animals, add money, select a product, and finish the transaction.
